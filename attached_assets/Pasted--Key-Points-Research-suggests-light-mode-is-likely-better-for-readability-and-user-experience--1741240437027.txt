### Direct Answer

For your application, it seems likely that light mode is the better choice for the color scheme, given its advantages in readability and familiarity, which are crucial for a repair AI assistant. Light mode, with dark text on a light background, is generally easier to read, especially in well-lit environments where users might be following repair instructions. This aligns with user psychology principles, making the interface more user-friendly by reducing cognitive load.

However, dark mode can be more comfortable in low-light conditions, potentially reducing eye strain for users working in dimly lit areas, like a garage at night. The evidence leans toward light mode for most users, but preferences vary, with some studies showing 22–28% preferring dark mode, while others report higher adoption among tech-savvy groups. An unexpected detail is the wide variability in user preference statistics, ranging from 22% to over 80%, depending on the user base, which underscores the importance of considering your target audience.

Given the focus on user experience and the need for clear, readable instructions, light mode is likely the better option, but offering a toggle for dark mode could cater to diverse user needs, especially if your application is used in varied lighting conditions.

### Survey Note: Comprehensive Analysis of Color Scheme Choice for User Experience in a Repair AI Assistant

This note provides a detailed examination of the choice between dark mode and light mode for user experience, particularly in the context of designing a repair AI assistant application, with a focus on user psychology and user-friendly design. The analysis draws on extensive research into color schemes, user preferences, and psychological principles to ensure a thorough understanding for application development.

#### Framework and Context
The user's query seeks to choose between dark and light color schemes for an application, following a discussion on designing a repair AI assistant using user psychology to enhance user experience. Dark mode refers to interfaces with a dark background and light text, while light mode uses a light background with dark text. This choice impacts readability, eye strain, and overall user comfort, especially for applications requiring prolonged interaction, such as a repair AI assistant.

#### User Experience Comparison: Dark Mode vs. Light Mode
Research suggests that the choice between dark mode and light mode significantly influences user experience, with each having distinct advantages and drawbacks. Light mode is traditionally more familiar, aligning with user psychology principles like using familiar patterns, which can reduce cognitive load and enhance usability. For instance, [NN Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/dark-mode/) notes that for people with normal vision, visual performance tends to be better with light mode, as it offers superior readability due to positive contrast polarity (dark text on a light background). This is crucial for a repair AI assistant, where users need to read detailed instructions clearly, especially in well-lit environments.

Conversely, dark mode is often preferred in low-light conditions for reducing eye strain. [SJ Innovation LLC](https://sjinnovation.com/dark-mode-vs-light-mode) highlights that dark mode, with lower luminance and reduced blue light emission, tends to cause less eye fatigue at night, which could be relevant for repair work in dimly lit areas like garages. However, [Alpha Efficiency](https://alphaefficiency.com/light-mode-vs-dark-mode) points out that dark mode can cause readability issues in bright conditions due to the "halation" effect, where light text on a dark background may bleed, potentially straining eyes in well-lit settings.

#### User Psychology and Design Principles
The user's focus on designing "as per user psychology and user-friendly, improving user experience" requires integrating psychological principles into the UI/UX design. Key principles from research include minimizing cognitive load, using familiar patterns, providing clear feedback, highlighting important elements, personalizing the experience, and guiding users step by step. Light mode aligns better with familiarity, as it mimics traditional interfaces, potentially reducing cognitive load for users accustomed to standard designs. For example, [Fireart](https://fireart.studio/blog/light-mode-vs-dark-mode-what-is-better/) notes that for people with normal vision, content is better perceived in light mode from a physiological perspective, supporting ease of use.

Dark mode, however, may appeal to modern, tech-savvy users and can create a sleek, focused atmosphere, which might enhance engagement for certain demographics. [Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/90961802/dark-mode-vs-light-mode-ux-debate-settled) suggests that dark mode is favored on OLED screens for battery savings and can reduce eye strain, aligning with principles of user comfort in specific contexts. However, the debate is ongoing, with [Email on Acid](https://www.emailonacid.com/blog/article/email-marketing/dark-mode-vs-light-mode-ux-debate/) noting that user preference varies, and context (e.g., reading long-form content vs. quick interactions) influences the choice.

#### Statistical Insights on User Preferences
User preference statistics reveal a complex landscape. [forms.app](https://forms.app/en/blog/dark-mode-statistics) reports that 28% of their users use dark mode, while [Chrome Platform Status](https://web.dev/prefers-color-scheme/) in December 2021 found that 22% of web traffic had the "prefer dark" setting enabled. Conversely, [Increditools](https://increditools.com/dark-mode-usage-statistics/) claims over 80% of device users prefer dark mode, and [WiFiTalents](https://wifitalents.com/statistic/dark-mode-usage/) suggests 82%, though these higher figures may reflect specific user bases like developers. [Android Authority](https://www.androidauthority.com/dark-mode-poll-results-1090716/) polls show most tech-savvy readers prefer dark mode, but this may not represent the general population. A [NN Group survey](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/dark-mode-users-issues/) of 115 mobile users found roughly one-third prefer dark mode, one-third light mode, and one-third use both, highlighting variability.

This discrepancy suggests that preference depends on factors like age, profession, and usage context. For a repair AI assistant, targeting a general audience, light mode might be more universally accepted, given its familiarity and better readability for most users. However, offering a toggle for dark mode could cater to users in low-light conditions, enhancing personalization and user control, as recommended by [Adam Fard](https://adamfard.com/blog/dark-mode-vs-light-mode).

#### Readability and Repair Context
Given the focus on a repair AI assistant, readability is paramount, as users need to follow instructions accurately in various lighting conditions. Research on readability, such as [Graphic Design Stack Exchange](https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/15142/which-is-easier-on-the-eyes-dark-on-light-or-light-on-dark), suggests that dark text on a light background is often preferred for general readability, especially in well-lit environments. [BOIA](https://www.boia.org/blog/dark-mode-can-improve-text-readability-but-not-for-everyone) notes that while dark mode can improve readability for some, it's not universally accessible, and light mode may be better for most users. This aligns with the need for clear, high-contrast text in repair guides, where users might be working in workshops or other well-lit areas.

An unexpected detail is the variability in statistics, with some sources suggesting over 80% dark mode preference among certain groups, contrasting with lower figures for general users. This variability underscores the importance of user testing and A/B testing, as suggested by [Fireart](https://fireart.studio/blog/light-mode-vs-dark-mode-what-is-better/), to determine the optimal mode for the target audience.

#### Detailed Considerations for User Experience
To further improve user experience, consider additional principles from research:
- **Goal Gradient Hypothesis**: Show progress bars for repair tasks, which can be more visible in light mode for clarity.
- **Investment Loops**: Provide rewards like completion badges, potentially more engaging in light mode for visibility.
- **Emotional Design**: Use gamification elements, which might stand out better in light mode for a bright, positive feel.
- **Focus and Attention**: Avoid distractions, ensuring high contrast, which light mode naturally provides, as per [UX Matters](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2023/12/color-psychology-in-visual-design-a-practical-guide-to-impacting-user-behavior.php).

These principles suggest that light mode aligns better with creating a user-friendly, engaging experience for a repair AI assistant, especially for a broad audience. However, dark mode's benefits in low-light conditions cannot be ignored, and offering both options with a toggle could be the most user-centric approach, though the question requires choosing one.

#### Conclusion and Recommendation
Given the evidence, light mode is likely better for user experience in a repair AI assistant, particularly for readability and familiarity, aligning with user psychology principles. It seems suitable for most users with normal vision, as supported by [NN Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/dark-mode/). However, the ongoing debate and variability in preferences suggest that user testing is crucial to confirm. Therefore, for a general recommendation, light mode is the better choice, but designers should consider offering a dark mode option for flexibility.
