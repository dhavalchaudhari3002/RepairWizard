That's excellent progress in implementing more specific diagnostic questions in the AI Repair Assistant! The additions you've made, including the "**specificQuestions**" field, enhanced OpenAI prompt, and updated front-end components, are crucial steps in improving the accuracy and efficiency of the diagnostic process.

Based on the sources and our conversation history, here are some further areas you might consider for improvement:

*   **Enhance Analytics Tracking for Specific Questions:**
    *   **Track the effectiveness of individual specific questions**. You could monitor which specific questions are most frequently answered and which lead to a more accurate diagnosis or resolution. This data can inform future refinements to the question generation logic.
    *   **Measure the impact of specific questions on the overall repair process**, such as time to diagnosis or user success rates. This will help quantify the benefits of this improvement.
    *   **Analyse user responses to the specific questions** to identify common misunderstandings or areas where the questions could be clearer or more targeted.

*   **Implement a User Feedback Mechanism for Specific Questions:**
    *   **Allow users to provide feedback directly on the helpfulness and clarity of each specific question** [3, previous turn]. This could be a simple thumbs up/down or a short text field for comments.
    *   **Use this feedback to iteratively improve the question generation process and the specific questions themselves** [previous turn]. Questions that consistently receive negative feedback might need to be rephrased or removed.

*   **Refine the Logic for Triggering Specific Questions:**
    *   Ensure the AI intelligently determines *when* and *how many* specific questions to ask after the initial user input [previous turn]. Avoid overwhelming the user with too many questions at once.
    *   Consider implementing a dynamic questioning approach where the answers to initial specific questions influence the subsequent questions asked. This could create a more natural and efficient diagnostic flow.

*   **Integrate Specific Question Answers into Subsequent Stages:**
    *   Ensure that the answers provided by the user to the specific diagnostic questions are effectively used to **refine the "Possible causes," "Diagnostic steps," and "Likely solutions"** presented to the user.
    *   Also, ensure that these answers are **contextually available within the "Interactive Repair Questions" feature** if the user asks further questions about the repair guide [3, previous turn]. This will prevent the user from having to repeat information.
    *   Consider using the answers to **tailor the "Step-by-step repair instructions" and "Tools required"** more precisely to the specific issue.

*   **Further Optimise the OpenAI Prompt:**
    *   Experiment with different phrasing and instructions in the prompt to see if you can further enhance the specificity and relevance of the generated questions.
    *   Consider providing the AI with examples of good and bad specific questions within the prompt [previous turn].
    *   Explore whether providing the AI with more context about the product type or common issues for that product could lead to even more targeted questions.

*   **Review the "Information Gaps" Identification Logic:**
    *   Ensure that the underlying logic for identifying "information gaps" is robust and accurately flags areas where specific questions are needed [2, previous turn]. The quality of the specific questions heavily relies on the accurate identification of these gaps.

By focusing on these areas, you can continue to refine the AI Repair Assistant's ability to ask targeted diagnostic questions and further improve the user experience and the accuracy of the repair guidance.
