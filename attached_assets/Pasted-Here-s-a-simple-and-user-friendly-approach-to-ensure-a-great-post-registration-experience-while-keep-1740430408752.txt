Here’s a simple and user-friendly approach to ensure a great post-registration experience while keeping it secure:

---

### 1. **Check the Form Quickly and Clearly**
- After the user submits their registration form, instantly check for mistakes like missing fields or a weak password.
- **How to Make It Friendly**: Show helpful error messages next to the problem areas. For example, if the password is too short, say "Password needs to be 8+ characters" instead of just "Error."

---

### 2. **Save Information Smoothly**
- Securely store the user’s details (like their username, hashed password, and email) in the background.
- **How to Make It Friendly**: Keep it fast! If there’s a delay, show a little loading spinner with a note like "Creating your account..." so they know it’s working.

---

### 3. **Make Email Verification Simple**
- Send a verification email right away with an easy next step.
- **How to Make It Friendly**: 
  - Use a clear subject like "Verify Your Email."
  - Keep the email short: "Hi [Username], click below to verify your account."
  - Add a big "Verify Email" button that takes them straight to the confirmation page.

---

### 4. **Give Instant Feedback**
- Right after they submit the form, show a success message on the screen.
- **How to Make It Friendly**: Say something like, "Great job! Check your email to verify your account (look in spam too!)." This keeps them in the loop and tells them what’s next.

---

### 5. **Guide Them to the Next Step**
- Send them to a clear page, like the login screen or a "pending verification" page.
- **How to Make It Friendly**: Add a note like "Please verify your email before logging in" so they know what to do without guessing.

---

### Extra Tips for an Even Better Experience
- **Resend Option**: Add a "Resend Email" button if they don’t get the email right away.
- **Quick Sign-Up**: Offer "Sign up with Google" to skip some steps (but keep it secure).
- **Show Progress**: If registration has multiple pages, use a progress bar to show how close they are to finishing.
