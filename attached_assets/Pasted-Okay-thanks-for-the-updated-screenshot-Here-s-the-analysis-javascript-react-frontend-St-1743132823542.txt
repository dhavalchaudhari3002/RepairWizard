Okay, thanks for the updated screenshot.

Here's the analysis:

javascript-react-frontend:

Still shows "Errors: 0" and "No activity yet."

The "Start Setup" button is gone, replaced by "Crash Free Sessions 100%". This sometimes means Sentry detected the SDK initialization attempt or received some kind of minimal data (like session data, if performance monitoring is enabled), but it hasn't received any actual error events yet. The 100% crash-free is likely the default because no sessions with crashes have been reported.

node-backend:

Now shows "Errors: 6" (increased from 3).

The graph shows recent activity.

This confirms your backend integration is still active and reporting errors.

Conclusion:

The fundamental issue remains: Your React frontend application is still not successfully sending error data to Sentry.

Troubleshooting Steps (repeat or verify carefully):

Verify SDK Initialization:

Go into your React project's code.

Find where you added Sentry.init({...}). Is it definitely there?

Is it being called early in your application's startup (e.g., in index.js or App.js before potential errors)?

Check the DSN Key:

Go to Sentry -> Project Settings for javascript-react-frontend -> Client Keys (DSN).

Copy the DSN value.

Go back to your React code where Sentry.init is called.

Paste the DSN directly into the dsn: 'PASTE_HERE' part of the configuration. Make absolutely sure it matches exactly and there are no typos or extra characters.

Trigger a Test Error:

In a component that you know renders in your React app, add a temporary button or use useEffect to intentionally cause an error after Sentry.init has run. Example:

// Inside a component
useEffect(() => {
  // Add a small delay to ensure Sentry is likely initialized
  setTimeout(() => {
    try {
      throw new Error("Sentry Frontend Test Error - " + new Date().toISOString());
    } catch (e) {
      Sentry.captureException(e); // Explicitly capture if needed, though unhandled should work too
    }
    // Or just:
    // throw new Error("Sentry Frontend Test Error - " + new Date().toISOString());
  }, 2000); // Wait 2 seconds
}, []);

// Or add a button:
<button onClick={() => { throw new Error("Button Click Test Error!") }}>
    Test Sentry Error
</button>


Run your frontend application and trigger this error (either automatically via useEffect or by clicking the button).

Check Browser Developer Tools:

Open your React app in the browser.

Open the Developer Tools (usually F12).

Console Tab: Look for any errors mentioning "Sentry", CORS problems, or failed initializations.

Network Tab: Filter for requests going to sentry.io (or your self-hosted domain). Do you see requests when you trigger the test error? What is the status code (200 is good, 4xx/5xx or (blocked) is bad)?

Check integrations, tracesSampleRate, replaysSessionSampleRate: If you added performance monitoring (tracesSampleRate) or session replay (replaysSessionSampleRate/replaysOnErrorSampleRate), make sure those are configured correctly (e.g., a value between 0 and 1). Even if errors aren't working, sometimes these can send some data that makes Sentry think setup is "done".

Environment: Ensure the environment option in Sentry.init (if you set one) matches what you expect (e.g., 'development', 'production').

Focus on steps 1, 2, 3, and 4 â€“ verifying the code, the DSN, triggering a test, and checking the browser console/network are the most critical steps now.
