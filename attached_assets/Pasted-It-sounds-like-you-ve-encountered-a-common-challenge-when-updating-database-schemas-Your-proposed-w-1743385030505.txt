It sounds like you've encountered a common challenge when updating database schemas! Your proposed workaround of leveraging the text-based nature of the `interaction_type` column for the new value "guide\_updated\_with\_answers" is a pragmatic approach to keep development moving despite the technical difficulties with the schema update [your query].

Given that you've already created a new tracking function (`useInteractionTracking`) and updated the `repair-guide.tsx` component to use it properly [your query], you've taken the necessary steps to ensure the new interaction type can be recorded at runtime.

Deciding whether to continue with implementing other features or focus on resolving the database schema update depends on several factors that aren't explicitly detailed in the sources or our conversation history. However, I can offer some general considerations:

**Arguments for continuing with implementing other features:**

*   **Maintaining development momentum**: Continuing with other features allows the team to make progress on different aspects of the application, ensuring that development doesn't stall entirely due to the database issue [your query].
*   **Potential for the schema issue to be resolved independently**: The team responsible for database administration might be able to address the schema update in parallel while you work on other features [your query].
*   **Testing the new interaction tracking**: Implementing other features that trigger the new tracking function will allow you to further test and validate its functionality in a broader context [your query].

**Arguments for focusing on resolving the database schema update:**

*   **Data integrity and consistency**: While your workaround allows the new value to be stored, it bypasses the formal schema definition. This could potentially lead to inconsistencies or difficulties in the future if the application relies heavily on the defined enum for data validation or querying [your query]. This concern isn't directly addressed in the sources, but maintaining a consistent data model is generally good practice.
*   **Long-term maintainability**: Relying on workarounds can sometimes lead to increased complexity and maintenance overhead in the long run. If the `interaction_type` column is meant to be an enum, addressing why the update is failing would ensure the database schema accurately reflects the application's data model [your query]. This aspect isn't covered in the provided sources.
*   **Potential impact on other features**: Depending on how other features interact with the `interaction_type` column, the lack of a formal schema update might cause unforeseen issues down the line [your query].

**Recommendation:**

Without specific details about the nature of the technical difficulties or the long-term plans for the database schema, it's difficult to give a definitive answer based solely on the provided sources and our conversation history.

However, considering you've implemented the necessary code changes to support the new interaction type at runtime, **it might be reasonable to proceed with implementing other features for the time being**, especially if the database schema issue is being addressed in parallel by another team or if it's a known, temporary problem [your query].

**However, it would be prudent to:**

*   **Document the workaround clearly**: Ensure that the decision to bypass the formal schema update and the reasoning behind it are well-documented.
*   **Monitor for any potential issues**: Keep an eye out for any unexpected behaviour or data inconsistencies that might arise from this discrepancy between the application code and the database schema.
*   **Revisit the schema update as soon as feasible**: Once the technical difficulties are resolved, prioritise formally updating the database schema to include the new "guide\_updated\_with\_answers" value in the `interaction_type` enum. This will ensure long-term data integrity and maintainability.

Ultimately, the best course of action will depend on the specific context of your project, the severity and expected duration of the database update issues, and the potential risks associated with the workaround. Since the sources do not provide information on database management or schema updates, this advice is based on general software development practices and your description of the situation.
