### Design Plan for Repair AI Assistant

#### **1. Color Scheme & Layout**
- **Light Mode**: Use a light background (e.g., off-white or light gray) with dark text (black or dark gray) for readability and familiarity.
- **Neutral Palette**: Keep colors minimal and subtle to avoid overwhelming users.
- **Simple Layout**: Design a clean, uncluttered interface with plenty of white space for easy navigation.

#### **2. UI & Navigation**
- **Familiar Design**: Use standard buttons and icons in predictable spots for intuitive use.
- **Minimalistic**: Avoid extra elements to reduce distraction and focus on the task.
- **Smooth Flow**: Add consistent back/next buttons to guide users between screens.

#### **3. AI Interaction**
- **Friendly Tone**: Make the AI’s responses natural and conversational, like a helpful guide.
- **Clear Language**: Keep answers short, simple, and free of technical jargon.

#### **4. User Journey**
- **Step-by-Step**: Break repair instructions into clear, numbered steps with brief descriptions and visuals (e.g., diagrams).
- **Progress Tracking**: Let users mark steps as done for a sense of accomplishment.
- **Gradual Info**: Show information bit by bit to keep it manageable.

#### **5. Key Screens**
- **Home**: Welcome text, search bar for issues, and quick links to recent repairs.
- **Issue Input**: Easy form with guided questions for the AI to analyze.
- **Repair Guide**: Step-by-step help with visuals and completion checkboxes.
- **Help**: FAQ or support option for extra assistance.

#### **6. Accessibility**
- **High Contrast**: Ensure text and visuals stand out.
- **Image Descriptions**: Add text for visuals.
- **Keyboard-Friendly**: Support navigation without a mouse.
